This app lets you quickly enable or disable the WiFi guest network of your Fritz!Box router.
The guest network is a second network, which can use a different name and password than your primary WiFi network. Also, devices connected to the guest network can not access the devices on the private primary one.
The guest network is useful for providing wireless internet access to someone, without revealing the personl WiFi password and granting access to all private devices on the network.

Your Fritz!Box router has to support the WiFi guest network feature and your Android device must be connected to the private Fritz!Box WiFi network to be able to change the guest network state.
